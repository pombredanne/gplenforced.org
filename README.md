There are lots of badges for people to put in their GitHub READMEs. CI status. Test coverage. Package version. Project license. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way for people to support GPL enforcement, too?

Well, now there is:

[![GPL enforced badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GPL-enforced-blue.svg "This project enforces the GPL.")](https://gplenforced.org)

See the live version at https://gplenforced.org for more.

## Contributing changes

I much, much prefer to use GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for tracking issues and patches, as they allow discussion to remain centralized and public. However, I understand that using GitHub isn't an option for some people, so you may also send patches or issues to me at <alex@strugee.net>.
