			<h1>This project believes in <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html">community-oriented</a> GPL enforcement.</h1>
			<h2>What's the GPL?</h2>
			<p>The GPL is a software license. It's a legal document that says how you're allowed to use the software, and it's designed to protect users' freedom to run software how <em>they</em> want to. You can read more about the GPL and freedom-respecting software - the social movement the GPL enables - <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">here</a>.</p>
			<h2>What's GPL enforcement?</h2>
			<p>GPL enforcement is the process of making sure that people and corporations respect the terms of the GPL. That means that when a company uses GPL'd software in their product and doesn't publish the source code, we work with them to correct the problem. If that doesn't work, we'll take legal action - although it rarely comes to that.</p>
			<p>This project believes in not abusing GPL enforcement, so it will enforce the GPL in accord with the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html">Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement Principles</a>.</p>
			<h2>I believe in GPL enforcement, too.</h2>
			<p>You can add the badge to (for example) your GitHub README. Here's what it'll look like:</p>
			<p><a href="https://gplenforced.org"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GPL-enforced-blue.svg" alt="GPL enforced badge" title="This project enforces the GPL." /></a></p>
			<p>And here's a snippet you can use to put this in your Markdown documents:</p>
			<p><code>[![GPL enforced badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GPL-enforced-blue.svg "This project enforces the GPL.")](https://gplenforced.org)</code></p>
			<p>You'll note that the badge links to this page and shows some text when you hover over it. The badge itself is SVG (i.e. a vector graphic) thanks to <a href="https://shields.io">shields.io</a>.</p>
			<p>Want to do more? Donating to the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> is a great way to contribute to community GPL enforcement.</p>
